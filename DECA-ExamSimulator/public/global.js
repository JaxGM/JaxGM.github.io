For example, a business could change the level of sales by different percentages, such as  5% or 10%, to find out the effect that would have on net income. The spreadsheet program automatically does  the calculations. Although keeping appointments might lead to sales, a salesperson would likely not use a  spreadsheet program to track appointments.
